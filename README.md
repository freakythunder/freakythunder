## Hey, I’m Bikash 👋

Welcome to my GitHub — where curiosity meets code, and every README is a live experiment.

### 🧠 **What’s On My Mind?**

- 🤖 **What if LLMs had sparring partners?**  
  Imagine two neural networks, each with their own “opinions,” debating a problem until they converge on a solution.  
  _Could this “AI Socratic method” spark new levels of reasoning and creativity?_
- 🌐 **Can AI agents really surf the web like us — or better?**  
  I’ve been deep-diving into how agents parse, interpret, and “think” about web data.  
  OCR and DOM extraction feel like relics — what if we designed a web that’s natively readable for LLMs?  
  _Is it time for a new web paradigm, built for machines and humans alike?_
- 🕳️ **Are neural networks still black boxes?**  
  We see the activations, but do we really “get” what’s happening inside? What do these neurons represent?  
  _What if we could visualize, interpret, and even interact with the “thoughts” of a model in real time?_

### 🛠️ **What I Build**

- 🚀 **AI-Driven Products:**  
  Co-founded PlatoEducation — an AI-powered coding education platform (React, Express, OpenAI, Azure).  
  Built secure, scalable, and cloud-native systems (JWT, AES, Docker, AWS Lambda).
- 📈 **Quantitative Research:**  
  Sharpe ratio 2+ alphas @ WorldQuant — finding signal in the noise, one dataset at a time.
- 🧬 **Data Science Experiments:**  
  From T-SNE and KNN to semantic clustering and feature engineering — I love turning raw data into insight.

### 🧩 **Let’s Collaborate**

- Building something that bends the rules of AI, web, or data?  
  Ping me — I’m always up for brainstorming, hacking, or just geeking out.
- Got a wild AI hypothesis, a half-baked idea, or a technical rabbit hole to dive into?  
  Let’s riff and see where curiosity leads.

*P.S. If you want to debate AI creativity, brainstorm next-gen agents, or just swap wild theories about the future of tech — you’re in the right place! 🚀*
